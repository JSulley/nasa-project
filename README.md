# NASA Mission Control Project

## Description

I've been curious about the back-end realm and wanted to learn more about it. At the same time, I want to appreciate and practice JavaScript more. I stumbled upon Node.js and heard about its capabilities and tools like Express.js. The course I decided to learn more about Node.js was Complete Node.js Developer: Zero to Mastery, where the project stems from (see [Credits](#credits) for more information). Despite this project being a full-stack application, the focus is developing the server component and connecting the front end to the back end.

The project goal: to build a Node API that allows users to schedule missions with the destination being a habitable Kepler Exoplanet.

So far, I've learned
- asynchronous JavaScript concepts (e.g., promises and `async await`)
- Node.js fundamentals (e.g., module system and package management)
- back-end concepts (e.g., HTTP methods, requests and responses, and routing)
- how to leverage Express.js to handle requests in a modular structure

My personal goals are
- to solidify the knowledge gained (so far) from the course
- understand JavaScript better
- learn more technologies/tools used to facilitate the back-end development process
