# NASA Mission Control Project

## Description

I've been curious about the backend realm and wanted to learn more about it. At the same time, I wanted to appreciate and practice JavaScript more. I stumbled upon Node.js and have heard about its capabilities and other tools used with it such as Express.js.
This full-stack application will mainly focus on the backend.
The project goal is to build a Node API that allows users to schedule missions with the destination being a Kepler Exoplanet that's considered habitable.

So far, I've learned about asynchronous JavaScript concepts such as promises and `async await`. I've also learned Node.js Fundamentals such as the Module System and Package Management.
My personal goals are...
- To solidify the knowledge gained (so far) from the Node.js course (see [Credits](#credits)) I'm taking
- Understand JavaScript better
- Learn more technologies/tools that are used to facilitate the backend development process
